        <h3>What's a Raptor Roundup</h3>

<p>For the past two weeks, as I've had to drive my two boys to school, I've had to listen to the same 5 episodes of Wild Kratts (a now
discontinued PBS cartoon series).  One of the episodes has to do with 'birds of prey', called raptors.  Since that episode is now
stuck in my head, I'd though I'd make this page about raptors.</p>

<h3>Defining Features of Raptors</h3>

<p>Raptor is derived from the Lation word "rapere" which means to seize, or capture.  To do that, they need certain features to
hunt and kill other animals.  What makes raptors different from other birds are the following features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hooked beaks with sharp edges</li>
    <li>feet with sharp, curved claws or talons</li>
    <li>keen eyesight</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Raptor Groups</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
<p>There are 446 species of raptors worldwide, and they are divided into five groups.  At your leisure, click on the links to
each page to discover a little bit more about each group:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Falcons</li>
  <li>Hawks</li>
  <li>Eagles</li>
  <li>Vultures</li>
  <li>Owls</li>
</ul>
